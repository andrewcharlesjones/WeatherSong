# VisualSounds

VisualSounds is an application that plays songs relevant to the contents of an image. By making use of the Clarifai and Spotify APIs, the program will make an educated guess of the dominant object in the image and begin playing a song relevant to that object.

To run the program, simply execute the run script (./run in the Terminal) and navigate your browser to localhost:4567/index.html.
